# Zendesk Article Backup

Since Zendesk does not yet provide a good way of backing up knowledge base articles, I have written a simple Python script to take care of this.

## Usage

Clone and replace the Zendesk URL with your own, and place the default language of your Zendesk instance (e.g. en-US).

Run the script with **python3 make_backup.py**
